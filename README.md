# Once Again, We Return

Welcome to the repo for this little side project of mine, which explores the [official Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/11LAaVMMhxPfSp4i2b6JRJ?si=5e49jfJAT3a6oI-GVlRyCA) for The Wicked + The Divine in fun ways.

[The Wicked + The Divine](https://www.wicdiv.com/) (aka WicDiv) is a comics series created by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie. It's very good, in my humble opinion.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
